<p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an internet protocol
that determines whether a given <a href="GUID-911E9F7E-D0AD-55EC-A3F4-1D427F803780.html">certificate</a> or a list of certificates has been revoked, and therefore, determines
whether the certificate can be trusted. The protocol is defined in <a href="../rfc/rfc2560.txt" target="_blank">RFC2560</a>. </p>
<p>On the Symbian platform, Secure Software Install
(SWI) uses OCSP to verify whether a certificate associated
with an application to be installed has been revoked. For details
of how SWI uses OCSP revocation check, see <a href="GUID-C893C9E6-47B8-5149-9808-0274C61CF3D7.html">OCSP SWI Integration</a>. </p>
<div id="GUID-F07B2071-BF8B-4D22-B6F6-1282B2040376"><h3 class="section-title">OCSP
request and response</h3> <p>OCSP primarily consists of two parts:
a request and a response, each specified in the Abstract Syntax Notation
One - Distinguished Encoding Rules (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4792" target="_blank">ASN.1</a> -DER) format. A client application that wants to get information
on the revocation status of a certificate, forms an OCSP request and
sends this to an OCSP server. In its simplest form, an OCSP request
consists of one or more identifiers for the certificates whose status
is in question. The request is sent to the OCSP server identified
by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The URI is specified either
in the Authority Information Access (AIA) extension of the certificate
whose revocation status is to be checked, or as a global URI with
the OCSP client. AIA is defined in <a href="../rfc/rfc2459.txt" target="_blank">RFC2459</a>. </p> <p>The OCSP server maintains information about the revocation
of certificates. The server replies to the client with a signed OCSP
response, mentioning the revocation status for each certificate. A
response being signed with a key pair is trusted as authoritative
by the client. Alternatively, a server can also return an error code
as response (refer to <a href="../rfc/rfc2560.txt" target="_blank">RFC2560</a> for details of the various OCSP errors).
OCSP is transport-neutral with the URI of the server indicating the
required transport mechanism. Currently, only Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) is supported. </p> <p>The client, in turn, verifies whether
the response is valid and is from a trusted entity. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-B4A093DA-6968-4B17-A3A7-7FF4800DED3B"><h3 class="section-title">OCSP
client-server interaction</h3> <p>The server to which the request
for revocation check is sent may not actually be the server which
is authoritative to answer the request, but may act as a proxy to
the destination server. For information on the server to which the
request actually gets routed, the client includes a <em>serviceLocator</em> extension (containing the URI) in the OCSP request. </p> <p>There
may be a <em>serviceLocator</em> extension for each certificate in the
request. Therefore, it is syntactically possible for the request to
be split into multiple parts, with each part routed to a different
OCSP responder (the server that actually responds to the OCSP request).
The intermediate server collates the individual responses into one
and returns this to the client. This response is signed only by the
intermediate server. In such a situation, the client must trust this
intermediate server. </p> <p>Three scenarios are associated with the
routing of OCSP requests to the appropriate responder through intermediate
servers. They are as follows: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-CD8AAEA0-AA94-58EA-978F-3C2E21A2FE9F"><a name="GUID-CD8AAEA0-AA94-58EA-978F-3C2E21A2FE9F"><!-- --></a><p> <strong>Single OCSP
responder</strong> </p> <p>One OCSP server contains the revocation information
for all the certificates to be checked. One request containing all
the certificates is sent to the responder (in this case, the OCSP
server), which replies with a single response. The following figure
illustrates the interaction between the OCSP client and a single destination
responder. </p> <div class="figure" id="GUID-11F6D229-29D0-510A-AB8A-64A906DC00F7"><img src="GUID-8E3F3745-7875-51A2-BDA1-AA537C7B220E_d0e465745_href.png" /></div> </li>
<li id="GUID-185C0C91-CC3F-5198-8EAB-BB1BF748A3D0"><a name="GUID-185C0C91-CC3F-5198-8EAB-BB1BF748A3D0"><!-- --></a><p> <strong>Multiple
OCSP responders using an intermediate OCSP server</strong> </p> <p>Multiple
OCSP responders use an intermediate OCSP server to route requests
to the appropriate destination responders. One request is sent to
the intermediate server, which sends multiple individual requests
to the destination responders. The responses are collated, and one
response is sent back to the client. The following figure shows the
interaction between an OCSP client and multiple destination responders
by using an intermediate responder. </p> <div class="figure" id="GUID-964E18AA-E4F7-5A71-A2F3-19F3007C24C6"><img src="GUID-2EF123C9-62A2-52FF-9792-66EF41F37452_d0e465761_href.png" /></div> </li>
<li id="GUID-F092252F-79EF-58E2-A596-77D3FC07CC54"><a name="GUID-F092252F-79EF-58E2-A596-77D3FC07CC54"><!-- --></a><p> <strong>Multiple
OCSP responders without an intermediate server</strong> </p> <p>The client
does the work of sending each request to the appropriate responder.
The client collates the responses received. The following figure shows
the interaction between the client and multiple destination responders. </p> <div class="figure" id="GUID-223A3DB6-538E-5A4E-946C-87AA03449857"><img src="GUID-A6F1F6AC-5D3C-5055-AEF1-B64671941BCB_d0e465777_href.png" /></div> </li>
</ul> <p>The choice of the correct method of interaction between the
client and the responders depends on the nature of the Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) and the availability of OCSP responders for routing
requests as intermediates. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-891303A3-070F-40D2-9382-40A1165928DE"><h3 class="section-title">Revocation
check results</h3> <p>If the response sent by the OCSP server passes
all the validation, the application that sends the OCSP request determines
the outcome by applying the following rules to the certificate statuses
in the response: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-124E3CDE-7F74-5960-A92C-98B101644036"><a name="GUID-124E3CDE-7F74-5960-A92C-98B101644036"><!-- --></a><p>If any certificate
is revoked, the result is <strong>Revoked</strong> </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-C0AF0A69-28C4-528B-9E14-1AAF13CEA497"><a name="GUID-C0AF0A69-28C4-528B-9E14-1AAF13CEA497"><!-- --></a><p>If all certificates
are valid, the result is <strong>Good</strong> </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-7BA5DACD-19B1-55CC-9378-28F4A47AAE12"><a name="GUID-7BA5DACD-19B1-55CC-9378-28F4A47AAE12"><!-- --></a><p>Otherwise, the
result is <strong>Unknown</strong>. </p> </li>
</ul> <p> <strong>Note:</strong> A certificate status of <strong>Good</strong> does not
indicate that the certificate may be trusted. It merely indicates
that the certificate has not been revoked. The normal validation of
that certificate (or the certificate chain in which it lies) must still be performed. </p> </div>
