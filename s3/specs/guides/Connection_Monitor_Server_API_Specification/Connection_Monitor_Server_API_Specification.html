           <p>
            Connection Monitor Server provides an API for applications to get information
about active data connections and other data connection related information
like connection method availability and WLAN information. Client applications
can receive this information via requests and events. Connection Monitor Server
API also provides a way to close any connection or all connections. This document
describes Connection Monitor Server API.

            The Connection Monitor Server API is a server-client API, that is, an active
object-based implementation encapsulating a client-server session interface.
The API is defined in
            <i>
             rconnmon.h
            </i>
            and the library is
            <i>
             connmon.lib
            </i>
            .

             Clients can access Connection Monitor Server by creating an object from
the
             <code class="ApiItem">
              RConnectionMonitor
             </code>
             class. This class is derived from
             <code class="ApiItem">
              RSessionBase
             </code>
             and
it provides methods for retrieving and setting attribute values from/to Connection
Monitor Server.
            </p>
            <p>
             In order to get notifications from Connection Monitor Server, an application
needs to implement the
             <code class="ApiItem">
              MConnectionMonitorObserver
             </code>
             class and
its pure virtual
             <code class="ApiItem">
              EventL
             </code>
             method. The Connection Monitor Server
API calls this method when an event occurs. Different events are implemented
as classes and all of them have a common base class.

            Using the Connection Monitor Server API
           </h1>
           <p>
            The client application first instantiates the
            <code class="ApiItem">
             RConnectionMonitor
            </code>
            class.
Then it can access all API methods. If the client application wants to listen
to notifications, it must implement the
            <code class="ApiItem">
             MConnectionMonitorObserver
            </code>
            class
and register an instance of it to the API. Most of the API calls are asynchronous
and can be cancelled.

              This attribute is used to retrieve the current signal strength. For WLAN,
if an active WLAN connection is present, the signal strength of that connection
is returned. Otherwise a WLAN scan is performed and the signal strength of
the strongest network found is returned.

               KWlanScanMaxDelay

              represents
the age (in seconds) of WLAN scan results that the client is willing to accept.
The valid value range is 0-60 seconds. Greater values are automatically set
to the maximum allowed value. The value -1 represents the device specific
default value (usually 7 seconds). The bigger this value is, the more likely
it is there will be a suitable WLAN scan result in cache when a WLAN scan
request is made. This leads to faster completion of WLAN scan requests and
also less frequent WLAN scanning performed by the device, which in turn leads
to longer battery life.

are automatically set to the maximum allowed value. If another process triggers
a WLAN scan while a scan request is waiting for this delay, the request is
completed early with the fresh scan results.

              This attribute is used to find out if a bearer is currently available.
To check for a specific bearer, the given connection ID should be one of the
bearer specific connection IDs. If the given connection ID belongs to a valid
connection, the availability of the bearer used by that connection is checked.

              This attribute is used to perform a WLAN scan for networks with a specific
SSID. The SSID is set with the string attribute
              <code class="ApiItem">
               KWlanSsid
              </code>
              .
If the SSID is empty (default), a normal broadcast scan is made. The request
works the same way as package attribute
              <code class="ApiItem">
               KWlanNetworks
              </code>
              , but
multiple simultaneous SSID scan requests from one client are not allowed.
Any extra concurrent requests are completed with error code
              <code class="ApiItem">
               KErrInUse
              </code>
              .
The information is transferred through a package (see
              <code class="ApiItem">
               CConnMonWlanNetworksPtrArrayPckg
              </code>
              ).
The package class has a buffer that the client needs to allocate memory for.
The buffer is filled with WLANs sorted by signal strength, strongest network
first. The buffer also contains the total amount of available WLANs and how
many of those fit inside the buffer.

              This attribute is used to perform a broadcast WLAN scan and retrieve the
beacon frames for found WLANs. The information is transferred through a package
(see
              <code class="ApiItem">
               CConnMonWlanProbeRawBuffersPckg
              </code>
              ). The package class
has a buffer that the client needs to allocate memory for. The buffer is filled
with WLAN beacon frames in no specific order, until all frames are entered,
or the buffer runs out of space. The buffer also contains the total amount
of available WLANs and the amount of beacon frames that fit inside the buffer.
The size of a beacon frame is usually somewhere between 60 and 300 bytes.
It consists of a fixed length header and a variable length body.

             Connection Monitor Server API has been designed to be extensible with new
query attributes and notifications without breaking the binary compatibility
in clients. However, it requires that the clients can handle the unrecognized
notifications. That can be done, for example, by ignoring them.

two applications have a data connection activated with the same IAP (and therefore
the same network interface), the number of connections is 1. Identified with
a connection ID.

connection. Identified with a subconnection ID. Support for sub- connections
