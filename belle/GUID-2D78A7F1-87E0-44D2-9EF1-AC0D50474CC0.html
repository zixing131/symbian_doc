the differences between a language and a writing system, why and how
writing system impacts software development. Writing system is a set
of rules for using one or more scripts to write a particular language.
Examples of different writing systems include: Chinese (logographic/ideographic),
Japanese (syllabic), English (Latin), Russian (Cyrillic), Greek (Greek),
Arabic (Bi-directional), Thai (Thai).</p>
<p>A natural language refers to the spoken and written forms of languages.
The Symbian platform language portfolio supports over 40 base languages
included at the time of the writing.</p>
<p>It is common to confuse language and writing system. Writing system
is something that is used to represent a language (or languages) in
written form. There are a number of languages that can be written
with more than one writing system, for instance, Japanese language
is written using four different scripts that form the Japanese writing
system. The four scripts are <em>hiragana</em>, <em>katakana</em>, <em>kanji</em> and <em>romaji</em>. Each script answers different needs
when writing Japanese. They are used for different purposes to present
the Japanese language. On the other hand, for example Serbian can
be written using either Latin or Cyrillic script, but they are not
used simultaneously – the writer decides which one to use. In some
cases, the choice of a writing system can be a political statement.</p>
<p>In some cases internationalization is simple, for example, making
a US application accessible to Australian or British users may require
little more than a few spelling corrections. But to make a US application
usable by Japanese users, or a Korean application usable by German
users, will require that the software operate not only in  different
languages, but use different input techniques, character encodings
and presentation conventions.</p>
<p>Qt tries to make internationalization as painless as possible for
developers. All input widgets and text drawing methods in Qt offer
built-in support for all supported languages. The built-in font engine
is capable of correctly and attractively rendering text that contains
characters from a variety of different writing systems at the same
time.</p>
<p>Qt supports most languages in use today, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All East Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese and Korean)</p></li>
<li><p>All Western languages (using Latin script)</p></li>
<li><p>Arabic</p></li>
<li><p>Cyrillic languages (Russian, Ukrainian, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Greek</p></li>
<li><p>Hebrew</p></li>
<li><p>Thai and Lao</p></li>
<li><p>All scripts in Unicode 5.1 that do not require special processing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On Windows, Unix/X11 with FontConfig (client side font support)
and Qt for Embedded Linux the following languages are also supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bengali</p></li>
<li><p>Devanagari</p></li>
<li><p>Dhivehi (Thaana)</p></li>
<li><p>Gujarati</p></li>
<li><p>Gurmukhi</p></li>
<li><p>Kannada</p></li>
<li><p>Khmer</p></li>
<li><p>Malayalam</p></li>
<li><p>Myanmar</p></li>
<li><p>Syriac</p></li>
<li><p>Tamil</p></li>
<li><p>Telugu</p></li>
<li><p>Tibetan</p></li>
<li><p>N'Ko</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these writing systems exhibit special features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Special line breaking behavior: Some of the Asian languages
are written without spaces between words. Line breaking can occur
either  after every character (with exceptions) as in Chinese, Japanese
and  Korean, or after logical word boundaries as in Thai.</p></li>
<li><p>Bidirectional writing: Arabic and Hebrew are written from right
to  left, except for numbers and embedded English text which is written
left to right. The exact behavior is defined in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/" target="_blank">Unicode
Bidirectional Algorithm</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-spacing or diacritical marks (accents or umlauts in European
 languages): Some languages such as Vietnamese make extensive use
of  these marks and some characters can have more than one mark at
the  same time to clarify pronunciation.</p></li>
<li><p>Ligatures: In special contexts, some pairs of characters get
 replaced by a combined glyph forming a ligature. Common examples
are  the fl and fi ligatures used in typesetting US and European books.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Qt tries to take care of all the special features listed above.
You  usually don't have to worry about these features so long as you
use  Qt's input widgets (for example, <code class="codeph">QLineEdit</code>, <code class="codeph">QTextEdit</code> and derived classes) and Qt's display widgets
(for example, <code class="codeph">QLabel</code>).</p>
<p> Support for these writing systems is transparent to the programmer
and completely encapsulated in Qt's text engine. This means that you
don't need to  have any knowledge about the writing system used in
a particular  language, except for the following small points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="codeph">QPainter::drawText(int x, int y, const QString &amp;str)</code> will always  draw the string with its left edge at the position
specified with  the x, y parameters. This will usually give you left
aligned strings.  Arabic and Hebrew application strings are usually
right  aligned, so for these languages use the version of <code class="codeph">drawText()</code> that  takes a <code class="codeph">QRect</code> since this
will align in accordance with the language.</p></li>
<li><p>When you write your own text input controls, use <code class="codeph">QTextLayout</code>.  In some languages (for example, Arabic or languages from the Indian
 subcontinent), the width and shape of a glyph changes depending on
the  surrounding characters, which <code class="codeph">QTextLayout</code> takes
into account.  Writing input controls usually requires a certain knowledge
of the  scripts it is going to be used in. Usually the easiest way
is to  subclass <code class="codeph">QLineEdit</code> or <code class="codeph">QTextEdit</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a table listing languages and related writing systems.
Some languages may use more than one writing system.</p>
<p>In the table below there are also languages listed that are not
included in the Symbian platform language portfolio, and they are
indicated by the italic typeface. These languages are included here
for reference only as to indicate which languages would basically
require only localization and variant testing, and no major changes
into the generic code.</p>
<p>Please note that the following table does not contain a full list
of writing systems in the world, but only writing systems typically
implemented in the IT industry are covered.</p>
