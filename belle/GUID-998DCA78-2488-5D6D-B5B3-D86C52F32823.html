keyspaces </h3> <p><strong>Steps to be taken at device creation</strong> </p><p>         There are two ways of equipping an application with a
keyspace when the application is installed on the device. One is to
save the keyspace to the directory <code>z:\private\10202BE9\</code>at ROM build, as explained above. This method has the disadvantage
that a keyspace created in this way cannot subsequently be uninstalled,
though it can be modified by the software installer or firmware upgrades.
The other way is to install the keyspace along with the application
using the software installer. Application writers cannot do this on
their own because the process requires one of the necessary files,
the stub .sis file, to be set up appropriately by device creators,
and another, the upgrade .sis file, to be signed by Symbian.  </p><p>          You install a keyspace by placing a stub .sis file (installation
file) in the <code>\System\Install</code>&lt;file&gt;\System\Install&lt;/file&gt;
directory in ROM. This file is written by device creators rather than
developers. It must contain the central repository server executable.
It must list all the ROM-supplied keyspace files which are ntended
to be upgradable.   </p><p>          The following template is supplied
for use in device creation. Device creators are free to modify the
major and minor version numbers but are strongly recommended to retain
the UID 0x20007770 which is allocated for use with the central repository.

</pre> <p><strong>How to upgrade a keyspace during software installation</strong> </p> <p>. It involves using the CreateSIS tool to compile files listed in
a package (.pkg) file into an installation (.sis) file. A package
file may refer to an existing .sis file: if so, the .sis file is said
to be embedded. An upgrade is essentially the installation of a software
patch. You upgrade a keyspace in the same way as you upgrade the associated
application and the two operations are often combined. Installing
a keyspace is the same as upgrading one: you are eclipsing the stub
.sis file discussed in the previous section. To do this you need: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-BCEB30EA-7C0F-5333-9033-0DA3521A56E7"><a name="GUID-BCEB30EA-7C0F-5333-9033-0DA3521A56E7"><!-- --></a><p>the upgrade
.pkg file and corresponding .sis file, </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-DA3E131F-98C3-57AF-BD28-C6858A2F53E4"><a name="GUID-DA3E131F-98C3-57AF-BD28-C6858A2F53E4"><!-- --></a><p>and the application
.pkg file and corresponding .sis file if you are upgrading the application. </p> </li>
</ul> <p>A third party developer cannot create a stub .sis file: it
must have been created as part of the device's ROM. If one does not
exist, you cannot upgrade a keyspace. </p> <p>The upgrade .sis file
must be signed. </p> <p>You do not need the application .sis and .pkg
files if you are installing or upgrading a keyspace without the associated
application. </p> <p>In both cases you write a .pkg file with details
of the software upgrade. It can upgrade the application and the keyspace
at the same time or could upgrade the keyspace alone as shown in the
following example: </p> <pre class="codeblock">&amp;EN

:"Symbian Software Ltd."

; Install keyspace in Central Repository’s private data cage
"12345678.cre"-"c:\private\10202be9\12345678.cre"
</pre> <p>The important thing is that the package UID, (0x20007770),
must match the UID in the stub package header. You compile the .pkg
file into a .sis file and, if required, go through the signing process
at this point. At this point you can deploy the keyspace .sis file
on its own. However, it is more usual to embed the keyspace .sis file
into your application .pkg file and install the application. </p> <p><strong>How to uninstall a keyspace during software uninstallation</strong> </p> <p>You uninstall a keyspace by uninstalling the application
which it was embedded in. This has the effect of uninstalling all
the software patches with which you upgraded the keyspace. If there
is a version of the keyspace in ROM, placed there at device creation,
it comes back into use. If the keyspace was installed subsequently
then no version of it remains after uninstallation. It is not possible
to remove individual upgrades, only the entire set of upgrades which
have ever been applied. </p> <p><strong>Effects of upgrading a keyspace
during software installation</strong> </p> <p>An upgrade to a keyspace
may conflict with user modifications to the keyspace. In that case
the existing settings are merged with those in the upgrading keyspace
in accordance with the following rules. The keyspaces are merged in
accordance with the principle that user modifications override upgrade
modifications. </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-D0E7853C-D91D-53C4-9DA8-C581A9AB5A79"><a name="GUID-D0E7853C-D91D-53C4-9DA8-C581A9AB5A79"><!-- --></a><p>If a setting
exists in the existing keyspace on the phone and the upgrading keyspace
and the existing setting has not been modified by the user, the upgrading
setting replaces the existing setting. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-C94441FB-0967-53D5-9EAE-750BDABE48E2"><a name="GUID-C94441FB-0967-53D5-9EAE-750BDABE48E2"><!-- --></a><p>If a setting
exists in the existing keyspace and the upgrading keyspace and the
existing setting has been modified by the user, the existing setting
is preserved. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-DEEF31A4-5CF6-540A-A81A-E43DF2026C77"><a name="GUID-DEEF31A4-5CF6-540A-A81A-E43DF2026C77"><!-- --></a><p>If a setting
exists in the existing keyspace but not in the upgrading keyspace,
the existing setting is preserved. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-1270CCEC-7836-51BA-99EA-9BD46CA4BBCA"><a name="GUID-1270CCEC-7836-51BA-99EA-9BD46CA4BBCA"><!-- --></a><p>If a setting
exists in the upgrading keyspace but not in the existing keyspace,
the upgrading setting is created. </p> </li>
</ul> <p>Upgrades preserve the existing platform security policies.
Metadata values assigned by default or to a range remain unchanged,
but metadata values of individual keys take their upgrade settings. </p> <p>The first time you upgrade a keyspace which is provided in ROM
you only need to list the keys which are being added to or changed
from the ROM keyspace. However, if you are performing an upgrade to
a keyspace which has previously been upgraded, you must include all
the changes in all the previous upgrades: this is also the case where
the keyspace was originally installed as an upgrade to a stub .sis
file. </p> <p>If there are notification requests on any of the keys,
the requests will complete as a result of installation, upgrading
and uninstallation. If transactions are pending during an upgrade
or uninstallation, those transactions will fail. It is advisable to
close all sessions on a keyspace before uninstalling. </p> </div>

updates</h3> <p>Symbian provides limited support for firmware updates
to ROM over a serial connection or by FOTA (firmware over the air).
The generic term for these firmware updates is FOTx. When this happens,
the Central Repository detects the upgrade when the device is next
restarted and makes corresponding updates to its keyspaces. A firmware
update reboots the device: as part of this process the Central Repository
gets the current ROM version using <code class="codeph">SysUtil::GetSWVersion</code> and compares it with a previously saved version. Where the Central
Repository detects a difference it merges the relevant keyspaces at
the level of the file or of individual settings. </p> <p>The rule
is that user values (settings modified by the user) override SWI values
(settings modified by a software upgrade or installation) and that
SWI values override ROM values. </p> <p>There are two cases where
a difference is resolved at the level of the file. </p> <ul>

is non-persisted (ROM was never overridden), the ROM update replaces
the current ROM. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-5388506C-9908-518E-A3B4-63E609E0BB55"><a name="GUID-5388506C-9908-518E-A3B4-63E609E0BB55"><!-- --></a><p>Where the ROM
update deletes an existing ROM file, any persisted keyspaces are removed
along with the deleted file. This rule also applies when the user
has modified the keyspace in existing ROM, but not when the software
installer has modified the keyspace in existing ROM. </p> </li>
</ul> <p>Where the ROM update conflicts with user-modified keyspaces
or SWI-modified keyspaces, the new ROM is merged with the persisted
file at the level of the setting. The rules for resolving conflicts
involve creation, modification and deletion of settings and they vary
according to the point at which a setting was created. </p> <ul>
